With increased rewards for the same amount of POKT staked, the new system of consolidated nodes would encourage inflation. This is an unintended side-effect, so the ServicerStakeWeightMultiplier was added in to offset the inflation, so that the amount of POKT created would be the same regardless of whether Stake-Weighted Servicer Rewards had gone into effect or not.

For example, if the way nodes are positioned in bins leads to an emission rate of 1.8 times of what would have been before, then this parameter would be set to 1.8 which would offset the rewards generated by exactly this amount.
